# 💣 GOsweeper

A desktop Minesweeper clone written in **Go**, built using the [raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) game library. ⚙️🎮

> ⚠️ **This project is a work in progress.**  
> Core gameplay and features are currently under development and not yet available.

## 🎯 Planned Features

- 🧩 Classic **Minesweeper gameplay**
- 🎚️ Multiple **difficulty levels**

- 🎨 Custom themes or skins
- 📊 Leaderboards or stat tracking
- 🌱 Deterministic board generation via seeds — replay or share exact board setups
- 💬 In-game chat or ping system for co-op mode

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Go](https://golang.org/) — efficient, compiled systems language
- [raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) — Go bindings for the raylib C library
